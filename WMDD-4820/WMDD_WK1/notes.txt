Values, Types and Operators:

Numbers

numbers in JavaScript are 64bit, which just indicates the amount of space in memory that is reserved
to store numbers in JavaScript. 64bit is a pretty big number, 18 quintillion(an 18 with 18 zeros after it)
unlike many programming languages JavaScript doesn't have different types of for integer and floats.
both 8 and 8.0 are simply number type.

Strings

strings are used to represent text and are enclosed in quotations.
"string"
'string'
are the same, just be consistent in whether you use double or single quotes

to include things like new lines, spaces and other non-printing characters use a \. for example: "1\n2" would return
1
2
\n indicates a new line.

string concatenation "one " + "two" === "one two"

Booleans

booleans return either a true or false as their value.
for example 3 < 10 would return true.

operators that can be applied to Booleans themselves are Logical Operators. 
|| or
&& and

ternary operator

a ternary operator is often used as a short hand for an if statement.

condition ? exp1 : exp2

if the condition is true exp1 is returned, if it is false exp2 is returned.

for example:
    console.log(3 < 4 ? 1 : 2); will return 1 because it is true
    console.log(4 < 3 ? 1 : 2); will return 2 because it is false


we will look at Objects, Functions, Undefined values in later classes.
