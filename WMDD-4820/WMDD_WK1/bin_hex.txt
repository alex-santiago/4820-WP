converting from hexadecimal to binary to decimal and back again.


Binary place values
512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Hexadecimal place values
4096 256 16 1


converting from binary to decimal is relatively easy, you just add up all of the positions

for example:

    00100010 using the place values above we can see that the value for 32 and 2 are 1, or "on", 
    if you imagine a value as being either on or off. so this binary number is 34.

converting to hexadecimal from binary is also not all that tricky. hex values can all be represented by 4 bits. 
so if we split our number of 8 in half we have 0010 | 0010 or two 2s so the Hexadecimal value would be 22

the trickiest conversion of the bunch is hexadecimal to and from decimal. but as we have just seen 
converting binary to and from hexadecimal isn't so bad, and neither is converting binary to decimal.
so generally if you ever have to do this in your head, or without a calculator I would recommend using 
binary as an intermediary stage.

decimal -> binary -> hexadecimal
hexadecimal -> binary -> decimal

for example if we have 0x A2C:
    first figure out how to express that as a binary number
    1010 | 0010 | 1100 
    or 2048 + 512 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 2604 so A2C = 2064.
