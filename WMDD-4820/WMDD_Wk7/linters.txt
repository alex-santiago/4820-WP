# linters

## what is a linter?

a code linter is a tool that can help you with finding errors in your code and helps to enforce
certain best practice style guidelines.

for example:

you have a variable 'smlSiz' and somewhere in your code you have accidentally
typed 'smlsiz.' a linter can help you find these pesky little errors.

    let smlSiz = 10

## javascript linters

there are a few out there, but i am only going to mention one:
[standardjs](http://standardjs.com/index.html).

## installing a linter

to install standardjs, and many other tools for javascript you need two tools:  
[node](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)  

fortunately node now comes with npm.

you also need a code editor and a tool to run your linter in your code editor


### atom  
[atom](https://atom.io/)  
[atom linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)  

### vim(or neovim)  
[vim](http://www.vim.org/)  
[neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake)

there are plenty of other code editors and linters for other languages, i will
leave it to you to explore if you are interested.
