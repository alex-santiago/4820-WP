# algorithmic thinking or pseudo code exercise 1

personal banking

write out the steps involved in a program that would keep track of the following bank accounts.  
you can use pseudo code (example below) but aren't required to write any javascript.

you have an income of 1500 per month.
you need to transfer 500 to an account that your rent comes out of.
500 stays in your primary account for monthly expenses
200 is transferred into one investment account
and the remaining 300 hundred another account.

your program should make these transfers automatically when you get payed and keep track of
the amount in all of these accounts


## pseudo code example

    if savings account receives payment
        transfer 500 $ to rent account

it is just plain english to express the logic of a program
