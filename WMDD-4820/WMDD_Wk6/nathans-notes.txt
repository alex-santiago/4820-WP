- intro to p5
- simple server

[p5](https://p5js.org/)

you will learn more about servers, their function, how to configure one... later
in the course. for now sometimes we will need to use a server to get our code to
work properly.

here are a few to chose from that do just enough for us right now

node js, this is what i often use in class  
[http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

then go to localhost:8080 in the browser

the two options below should work in the mac labs on campus(use python 2 for
macs by default)

[python](https://www.python.org/)  
`python -m -m http.server`  
or for python 2  
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

then go to localhost:8000 in your browser

[php](https://secure.php.net/)  
`php -S localhost:8080`

then go to localhost:8080 in the browser
